AIRTOOLS is a collection of programs to aim at astronomical image reduction
of both CCD and DSLR observations on Linux. The main tasks are implemented as
shell functions (bash) in a single file airfun.sh. These functions are build
around many tools readily available for most Linux desktops, including
- ImageMagick
- Netpbm
- WCSTools
- Gnuplot
- XPA messaging tools

The primary intention of the airtools software is the analysis of comet
observations. New procedures were developed to measure the total coma
brightness. Those image reduction steps are easily accessible as analysis
tasks from the SAOImage display GUI.


The shell functions also involve powerful third party software used in
professional astronomy, which is freely available but not (yet) packaged by
most Linux distributions and therefore must be installed separately:

- Astromatic software: sextractor, scamp, skymaker, stiff, swarp
  (by E. Bertin, http://www.astromatic.net)
- stilts - table processing (by M. Taylor, http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stilts/)
- SAOImage DS9 - image display and GUI (http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html)

In addition, subsets of some smaller tools are used:

- cdsclient for fast access to astronomical databases at CDS
  (http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/doc/cdsclient.html)
- cexamples FITS routines
  (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/cexamples.html)


For your convenience, sources of all external programs have been bundled in
a single archive which can be downloaded via
    https://github.com/ewelot/temp/raw/master/bundle3rd.tar

Instructions on compilation/installation of all required software components
can be found in the INSTALL file.

In addition the software can be tested on any operating system without altering
the current system by running a Linux Live-CD/DVD in a virtual machine (e.g.
VirtualBox). The script
    https://github.com/ewelot/airtools/raw/master/setup_airdeb.sh
can be used on a live CD from a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distribution to
have an almost automatic download/compile/install procedure and finally starts
the software using some sample data.
