AIRTOOLS is a collection of programs to aim at astronomical image reduction
for both CCD and DSLR observations. The main tasks are implemented as shell
functions (bash) in a single file airfun.sh. The functions utilize many tools
readily available for most Linux desktops, including
- ImageMagick
- Netpbm
- WCSTools
- Gnuplot
- XPA messaging tools

Special attention was drawn to support observations of comets. New procedures
were developed to measure the total coma brightness. Those image reduction
steps are easily accessible as analysis tasks from the SAOImage display GUI.


The shell functions also involve powerful third party software used in
professional astronomy, which is freely available but not (yet) packaged by
most Linux distributions and therefore must be installed separately:

- Astromatic software: sextractor, scamp, skymaker, stiff, swarp
  (by E. Bertin, http://www.astromatic.net)
- stilts - table processing (by M. Taylor, http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stilts/)
- SAOImage DS9 - image display and GUI (http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html)

In addition, subsets of some smaller tools are used:

- cdsclient for fast access to astronomical databases at CDS
  (http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/doc/cdsclient.html)
- cexamples FITS routines
  (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/cexamples.html)


For your convenience, sources of all external programs have been bundled in
a single archive which can be downloaded via
    https://github.com/ewelot/temp/raw/master/bundle3rd.tar

For further instructions on compilation/installation of all required software
components, please read the INSTALL file.
