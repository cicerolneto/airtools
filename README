AIRTOOLS is based on many programs/tools which are available from package
repositories of most Linux distributions, including:
- ImageMagick
- XPA messaging tools
- WCSTools
- Gnuplot


It also uses powerful third party astronomical software packages:

- Astromatic software (E. Bertin, http://www.astromatic.net)
    sextractor
    scamp
    skymaker
    stiff
    swarp

- stilts (M. Taylor, http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stilts/)
    Table processing (e.g. manipulation of FITS tables)

- SAOImage DS9 (http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html)
    Astronomical imaging and data visualization.


In addition, subsets of some smaller tools are used:

- cdsclient (http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/doc/cdsclient.html)
    Fast access to astronomical databases at CDS 
- cexamples (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/cexamples.html)
    Simple FITS routines


For your convenience, sources of those external programs have been bundled in
a single archive (bundle3rd.tar) which must be downloaded separately.
