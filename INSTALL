Software Requirements:
-----------------------

The AIRTOOLS software relies on a number of other programs to be present on
runtime. Many of those are available in the form of software packages from
your Linux distribution. Installation on a Debian/Ubuntu-based distribution
is done via the following command (run as root):

    apt-get update
    apt-get install imagemagick xpa-tools wcstools gnuplot-x11 \
        librsvg2-bin potrace exiftool curl wget gawk default-jre


Build dependencies:
--------------------

Building the included C programs and those from third party software depends
on a number of libraries which can be installed via:

    apt-get install libnetpbm10-dev libjasper-dev libjpeg-dev libcfitsio3-dev \
        libtiff5-dev libfftw3-dev libblas-dev libatlas-base-dev \
        libplplot-dev plplot12-driver-xwin plplot12-driver-cairo libshp-dev


Installation:
--------------

Default installation prefix is /usr/local, which means binaries are installed
in /usr/local/bin. While the compilation is done as a regular user, the
installation into system directories requires root privileges. Many systems
use 'sudo' to achive this.

Installation consists of several steps.

Unpacking archives (in any temporary directory):
    tar xf airtools-*tar.gz
    tar xf bundle3rd.tar

Compiling and installing AIRTOOLS:
    cd airtools-*
    make
    sudo make install

Compiling and installing external software packages (from bundle3rd.tar):
    make externc
    sudo make install_externc
    make astromatic
    sudo make install_astromatic
    sudo make install_ds9
    sudo make install_stilts


Troubleshooting plotting in scamp
----------------------------------

To prevent problems with buggy plplot drivers on some new linux systems
it is advised to remove those drivers after successful compilation:
    sudo apt-get remove plplot12-driver-qt
